# Data science portfolio

Welcome to Daniel Nason's data science portfolio!

## My career journey

While I did not start my career as a data professional, after returning to school to get my master's degree in Statistics I was able to successfully change my career path into data. I am passionate about statistics and machine learning, as well as applying new tools and methodologies and collecting, processing, exploring, and analyzing data and extracting insights to make informed decisions.

## Projects

[Statistical Genomics and High Dimensional Inference](./Statistics_Genomics_High_Dimensional_Inference/README.md)

This was a data science project using R to perform analyses of high-dimensional data.

[Employee Attrition Prediction](./Employee_Attrition_Prediction/README.md)

This was a data science project that used R and Python to build classification models on data from a Kaggle competition to predict an employee's likelihood of attrition.

[Program Language Usage Forecasting](./Programming_Language_Forecasting/README.md)

This was a data science project where I collaborated with my classmates and used R to build time-series models, including ARIMA and VARMAX models, for inference and forecasting of existing programming languages based on their StackOverflow frequency.

[Capital Bikeshare Prediction Analysis](./Capital_Bikeshare_Analysis/README.md)

This was a data science project originally from my master's program that I reworked using Python to collect, process, explore, and model availability of bikes at different rideshare stations in and around Washington, D.C.

[Masters's Program Capstone - PHIGHT COVID](./Capstone_PHIGHT_COVID/README.md)

This was my master's program capstone project that built off previously completed [work](https://github.com/alexazhu/PHIGHT-COVID) to explore the impact of K-12 teaching posture on COVID-19 disease transmission and outcomes.

[Deal or No Deal Banker Analysis and Simulator](./DOND_Analysis/README.md)

This project collects and explores how a the banker in the popular game show [Deal or No Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deal_or_No_Deal_(American_game_show)) offers deals to players. In addition to modeling the banker's behavior based on the status of a player's board, it also develops a simple simulator that allows you to play the game with simulated offers generated based on historical game data.

[Super Bowl Random Grid Generator](./Super_Bowl_Random_Grid/)

This was a fun little piece of code I wrote leading to create a random grid of all possible units digits combinations for the two teams playing in the Super Bowl, where the person who had the box at the end of quarter score was the winner.
