# Data science portfolio

Welcome to Daniel Nason's data science portfolio!

## My career journey

While I did not start my career as a data professional, after returning to school to get my master's degree in Statistics I was able to successfully change my career path into data. I am a data scientist with a passion for learning new tools and methodologies, as well as collecting, processing, exploring, and analyzing data and extracting insights to make informed decisions.

## Projects

[Statistical Genomics and High Dimensional Inference](./Statistics_Genomics_High_Dimensional_Inference/README.md)

This was a data science project using R to perform analyses of high-dimensional data.

[Employee Attrition Prediction](./Employee_Attrition_Prediction/README.md)

This was a data science project that used R and Python to build classification models on data from a Kaggle competition to predict an employee's likelihood of attrition.

[Program Language Usage Forecasting](./Programming_Language_Forecasting/README.md)

This was a data science project where I collaborated with my classmates and used R to build time-series models, including ARIMA and VARMAX models, for inference and forecasting of existing programming languages based on their StackOverflow frequency.

[Capital Bikeshare Prediction Analysis](./Capital_Bikeshare_Analysis/README.md)

This was a data science project originally from my master's program that I reworked using Python to collect, process, explore, and model availability of bikes at different rideshare stations in and around Washington, D.C.

[Masters's Program Capstone - PHIGHT COVID](./Capstone_PHIGHT_COVID/README.md)

This was my master's program capstone project that built off previously completed [work](https://github.com/alexazhu/PHIGHT-COVID) to explore the impact of K-12 teaching posture on COVID-19 disease transmission and outcomes.

[Deal or No Deal Banker Analysis and Simulator](./DOND_Analysis/README.md)

This project collects and explores how a the banker in the popular game show [Deal or No Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deal_or_No_Deal_(American_game_show)) offers deals to players. In addition to modeling the banker's behavior based on the status of a player's board, it also develops a simple simulator that allows you to play the game with simulated offers generated based on historical game data.
